============= Step 1 — App Launch & PDF Load ===========
User opens app → picks a PDF file
         ↓
PdfEditorScreen receives pdfPath
         ↓
initState() → _loadPdfBytes()
         ↓
File(pdfPath).readAsBytes() → reads PDF into Uint8List _pdfBytes
         ↓
SfPdfViewer.memory(_pdfBytes) renders the PDF on screen

============ Step 2 — Enter Pin Mode ============
User taps 📍 Pin button in toolbar
         ↓
_togglePin() called
         ↓
_isPinMode = true
         ↓
AppBar subtitle changes to "📍 Tap on the PDF to place a pin"
Toolbar pin button glows with selected color

============== Step 3 — Place a Pin ==============
User taps anywhere on the PDF
         ↓
SfPdfViewer.onTap fires → _onViewerTap(PdfGestureDetails details)
         ↓
details gives us 3 things:
  ├── details.pageNumber  → which page was tapped (e.g. page 1)
  ├── details.pagePosition → exact X,Y in PDF coordinates (for saving)
  └── details.position    → X,Y on screen (for live preview overlay)
         ↓
_PinData object created and added to _pins list
         ↓
setState() triggers rebuild
         ↓
Flutter Icon(Icons.location_on) appears on screen at tap position ← live preview
HapticFeedback fires
Snackbar shows "📍 Pin placed! Tap Save to embed it."

============ Step 4 — Save & Burn Pin into PDF =============
User taps Save button
         ↓
_savePdf() called
         ↓
PdfDocument(inputBytes: _pdfBytes) ← opens PDF for editing
         ↓
Loop through every pin in _pins list:
  ├── Get correct page → document.pages[pin.page - 1]
  └── _drawPinOnPage(x: pin.pdfX, y: pin.pdfY, color: pin.color)
            ↓
      PdfGraphics draws directly on the page:
        1. Circle (pin head) with selected color
        2. White highlight dot inside circle
        3. Triangle pointing down (pin tail)
        4. Dark dot at the tip
         ↓
document.saveSync() → exports final Uint8List with pins burned in
document.dispose()

=========== Step 5 — File Saved to Device ============
annotatedBytes ready
         ↓
FileSaveDirectory.saveFile() → saves to public Downloads folder
         ↓
File(privatePath).writeAsBytes() → saves private copy for reliable open
         ↓
_pdfBytes = annotatedBytes  ← viewer updates with new burned-in version
_pins.clear()               ← overlays removed (now part of PDF)
_isPinMode = false
         ↓
OpenFileAndroid().open(privatePath) → PDF opens in device's PDF viewer
         ↓
✅ User sees the saved PDF with 📍 pins permanently embedded
Snackbar shows "Saved to Downloads!"

============ Full Visual Summary ==================
Pick PDF → Load bytes → View PDF
                              ↓
                        Tap Pin button
                              ↓
                        Tap on PDF → preview overlay appears
                              ↓
                        (optional) change color / undo
                              ↓
                        Tap Save
                              ↓
                   Draw pin shapes onto PDF pages
                              ↓
                   Save to Downloads folder
                              ↓
                   PDF opens automatically ✅
The key insight is that there are two coordinate systems working together — screenX/Y for the live Flutter overlay you see while editing, and pdfX/Y for the actual vector shape burned into the PDF file permanently.
